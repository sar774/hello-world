Lab 2: Machine Learning Problem Identification

Dataset Description :
The Titanic dataset is a tabular dataset that contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic. 
The dataset includes attributes such as passenger class, gender, age, fare, and survival status. 
It is commonly used for machine learning classification tasks.

 Machine Learning Problem :
The objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their personal and travel-related features. 
This is a supervised classification problem where the model learns from labeled data.

Problem Type : Classification

Target Variable :
Survived  
0 = Did not survive  
1 = Survived
